        <h1>Pokemon Fangame Projects</h1>
        <p>Now you may be asking youself, what exactly they are? A Fangame simply is a game based on a series that you enjoy and try to emulate the style of. 
            <br>Though to the Pokemon Community it's a bit different, in this community there are two types of games you can make, ROM Hacks or Fangames. 
            <br><br>
            <span style="color:white">A ROM Hack</span> takes and edits the original code of the ROM used to build the new experience around what is present, and with the big benefit of being playable on original systems!
            <br><br>
            <span style="color:white">A Fangame</span> makes use of a 3rd party program, mainly RPGMaker XP. One downside of the games being made on a different program means it won't be playable on original systems like ROMs can.</p>
