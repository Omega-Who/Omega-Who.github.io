        About Me
      </h1>
      <div style="text-align: left;">
        <p>
          I am a aspriring 19 year old developer, I work on Pokémon fangames, hobby projects, and an ameatuer website developer.
          I'm currently attending college to get a computer science degree, as of yet im unsure what field I will specify in as I enjoy
          making games but also recognize it as a challanging field to become engrosed and prosper in. I enjoy playing video games, 
          working on random website designs, VR Tech, and reading comics.
        </p>
        <br><p>
          I only have a small handful of projects I can say im proud of working on or making and those can be seen in the 
          <span style="font-weight: bold;"><a href="projects.html" style="color:aliceblue; text-decoration: underline;">Projects</a></span>
          tab of my Portfolio, it will be updated to represent more projects that I make or help on as time passes, my main project right now
          is my own personal Fangame "Pokémon Crimson", I use it as a way to work on learning ruby while doing one of my hobbies. My only other
          solo project is "Omega's Labyrinth" which was made in my CS 162 Highschool class in 2022, I hope to remake it in the future and add 
          more content and capabilities to the code base then what was present from the tutorial series that allowed for the creation of the project.
        </p>
        <br><p>
          Content that I am confident in making is, Top Down RPG Maps this can range from Pokémon maps to actual JRPG, ARPG, and WRPG Maps; 
          Simple websites (HTML and CSS), along with basic programs using my knowledge of C and C++.
        </p>

          If you wish to contact me, the
          <span style="font-weight: bold;"><a href="contact.html" style="color:aliceblue; text-decoration: underline;">Contacts</a></span>
          tab will have all the info needed to reach out to me, I do have an 
          <span><a href="mailto:parkerccontact@gmail.com" style="color:aliceblue; text-decoration: none;">email</a></span>
          that can be contacted though I have not hosted it on this website 
          as a means of closing myself off to spam emails from random people asking me to take part in NFT projects or similar ventures. If you are
          looking to contact me for a reason regarding NFTs or Web3 projects, I advise you to find a different person.
